## Compilation of Linux Kernel for Debian

This is a Bash script to simplify the compilation of Linux Kernel for Debian.

## Usage

To begin, download the script :
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iFufutor/kernel_autocompile/master/kernel_compilation.sh
chmod +x kernel_compilation.sh
```

**PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU RUN THE SCRIPT AS ROOT**

You have to pass the version of Linux Kernel version you want to compile, as argument of the script.
`./kernel_compilation.sh 4.9` for example...
